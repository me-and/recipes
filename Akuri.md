=====

Based on [Meherwan Irani's Akuri at Food52](https://food52.com/recipes/86055-meherwan-irani-akuri-parsi-scrambled-eggs-recipe).

Goes well served with paratha.

Ingredients
-----------

-   One finely chopped white onion
-   ½ tin chopped tomatoes
-   ½ teaspoon turmeric
-   ¼ teaspoon dried chilli seeds
-   4 eggs
-   1 tablespoon cream (double / single / whatever)
-   1 tablespoon butter
-   Vegetable oil

Process
-------

1.  Fry the onion in a large non-stick pan until it's turning brown at the edges
2.  Add tomato, turmeric and chilli seeds[^1][^2]
3.  Cook on medium for a couple of minutes, stirring occasionally
4.  In the meantime, whisk the eggs and cream until thoroughly combined
5.  Once most of the liquid has cooked off, add the egg mix to the pan
6.  Cook the egg + tomato mix on a low heat, stirring frequently, until the egg starts to form curds
7.  Add the butter, keep stirring frequently
8.  Once everything is heated through and the egg looks appropriately cooked, serve

[^1]: The original recipe says to add the chilli later, but we're using dried chilli seeds so we want to give them chance to absorb some of the liquid off the tomatoes
[^2]: The original recipe also says to add the turmeric later, but we're using relatively dry tinned tomatoes; if we were using fresh tomatoes, we'd want to let some of the tomato liquid cook off first, lest the turmeric absorb too much liquid and not manage to toast a bit during the cooking
