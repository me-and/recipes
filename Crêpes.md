Crêpes
======

Ingredients, option 1
---------------------

As taken from the underside of our crêpe pan.

-   1 egg
-   100g flour
-   300ml milk
-   15ml melted butter
-   More butter for frying

Ingredients, option 2
---------------------

Per Alex.

-   2 eggs
-   140g plain flour
-   250ml milk ("wobbles a bit depending on what size egg you're using")
-   Rosemary if this is for a Yorkshire pudding
-   Butter for frying

Process
-------

Ideally leave to rest for a bit, potentially overnight, although nobody bothers
with that.

When cooking, let the butter brown a bit before adding the batter.
