Broad bean kuku
===============

Based on a recipe from an Ottolenghi book.  Don't ask me which one, that would have been a useful thing to note down…

Serve with rice, maybe, or just salad, depending on how much you're craving carbohydrate.

Ingredients
-----------

-   500g frozen broad beans
-   45g dried barberries[^2]
-   3tbsp double cream
-   ¼tsp saffron
-   5tbsp olive oil
-   2 medium onions, finely chopped
-   4 garlic cloves, crushed
-   7 medium eggs
-   1tbsp plain flour
-   ½tsp baking powder
-   30g dill, chopped
-   15g mint, chopped
-   salt + pepper

Process
-------

1.  Put oven on to heat to 180C / 160C Fan.
2.  Boil water, add broad beans, simmer for 1 minute, then drain and rinse under cold water.
4.  Bring double cream, saffron and 2tbsp water to the boil. Remove from the heat immediately, then set aside for 30 minutes to infuse.
5.  Get a non-stick, oven-safe frying pan with a lid. Heat 3tbsp olive oil, then add the onions. Cook the onions for ~4 minutes, then add the garlic and cook for a further ~2 minutes. Add the broad beans and set aside.
6.  Beat the eggs in a bowl until frothy. Add flour, baking powder, saffron cream, dill, mint, 1½tsp salt, ½tsp pepper, and whisk well.
7.  Add barberries and broad beans to the egg mixture.
8.  Wipe the frying pan clean (or don't…), add 2tbsp olive oil, and place in the oven for 10 minutes to heat.
9.  Add the egg mixture to the pan, add the lid, then bake for 15 minutes.
10.  Remove the lid, bake for another 20–25 minutes[^1], or until the eggs are set.
11.  Remove from the oven, rest for five minutes, then invert onto a serving plate.

[^1]:  This is Ottolenghi's timings; I think this results in an over-cooked kuku, and it probably wants much less time. Watch until the eggs are barely set; 10 minutes seemed more plausible, but possibly even less than that!
[^2]: The original recipe has these soaked in sugar syrup for a while before use. That definitely makes them sweeter, but we're not convinced that's an improvement, especially given the extra effort required
