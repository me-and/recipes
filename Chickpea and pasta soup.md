# Chickpea and pasta soup

Originally from Anna Del Conte, via Nigella Lawson and [the Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/8c98c6bc-310e-4d69-91a2-19cfb29743fc).

Leftovers will turn solid, and Nigella suggests they should be "eaten at a balmy room temperature with a fine grating of lemon zest, a fresh springling of chopped parsley and a good glug of olive oil."

## Ingredients

- 250g dried chickpeas[^1]
- 1 tbs bicarb
- 3 tbs flour
- 3 tbs salt
- 4.5 litre stock
- 4–5 fresh rosemary sprigs[^2]
- 12 garlic cloves, peeled and bruised
- 180ml extra virgin olive oil
- 600g skinned fresh tomatoes, seeded
- 400g small tubular pasta such as ditalini
- Parmesan cheese
- Black pepper

## Process

1. Soak the chickpeas[^3]
    1. Put the chickpeas in a bowl and cover with plenty of water
    2. Mix the bicarb, flour and salt, plus enough water for a thin paste.
    3. Stir the bicarb paste into the chickpeas and leave for at least 12 hours to help soften the skin of the chickpeas
    4. Wait for the chickpeas to have doubled in weight.
    5. Drain and rinse the chickpeas.
2. Put the chickpeas into a large stockpot and add the vegetable stock (or use two smaller stockpots).
3. Tie the rosemary in a muslin bag and add to the stockpot.
4. Add the garlic and half the oil to the stockpot. 
5. Cover the stockpot tightly and bring to the boil, then cook on a low simmer until the chickpeas are tender, c. 2–4 hours. Do not uncover the pan for the first 1½ hours or the chickpeas will harden.
6. Once the chickpeas are tender, remove the garlic and rosemary bundle, both of which should be floating on the surface of the soup.
7. Puree the tomatoes and add to the soup, including the juice.
8. Stir well, add salt and pepper to taste, and cook for another 10 minutes or so.
9. Add pasta, plus additional boiling water if necessary, and cook until al dente.
10. Serve soup with a drizzle of oil in each bowl, and parmesan to taste.

[^1]: The original recipe apparently called for 600g chickpeas; reducing to this amount is a change from Nigella.
[^2]: Nigella suggests potentially swapping for thyme.
[^3]: Nigella suggests this can be skipped by using a slow cooker or pressure cooker; exact steps are left as an exercise to the reader…
