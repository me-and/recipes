Crumpets
========

Based on [Waitrose' overnight crumpets recipe](https://www.waitrose.com/ecom/recipe/overnightcrumpets).

Ingredients
-----------

-   225g strong white bread flour
-   1tsp dried yeast
-   1tsp salt
-   200g milk
-   75g water
-   Butter for greasing

Process
-------

-   The night before
    1.  Mix together flour, yeast and salt in a mixing bowl
    2.  Add milk and water while stirring
    3.  Stir until there are no dry patches of flour; it's fine to be a bit
        lumpy
    4.  Cover and leave for 30 minutes
    5.  Put in the fridge overnight
-   In the morning
    1.  Remove from the fridge and leave somewhere warm for 30-45 minutes
    2.  Grease rings with butter and heat in a frying pan
    3.  Fry for 10-12 minutes apiece until the tops are dry (optionally help
        any bubbles pop with a skewer)
    4.  Remove the rings and flip, then cook for 5-6 minutes until golden on
        top

Notes
-----

Waitrose say you can increase to 7g of yeast and use water that's just off the
boil if you don't want to leave the mix overnight.  In that case, cover and
leave to rest somewhere warm for an hour, then cook straight away.
