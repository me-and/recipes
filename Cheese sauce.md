Cheese sauce
============

Key trick to my cheese sauce is using cornflour.  Combine milk and cornflour,
add heat, stir continuously.  Add milk or flour to adjust consistency as
required, but be aware the cornflour will mean the mix gets a lot thicker very
suddenly once it gets up to temperature.

I've never got the hang of making a roux, and have always just relied on
breaking up any lumps of flour as I spot them...

Once the mix is slightly thinner than desired, add cheese and bring to a brief, low boil.

Consider adding extra flavours – cinnamon, wholegrain mustard, ... – to the
white sauce while it's heating.
