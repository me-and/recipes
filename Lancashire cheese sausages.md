Lancashire cheese sausages
==========================

Based on p72 of Simon Rimmer's *The Accidental Vegetarian*.  For a while in my
mid-twenties, these were my signature dish.

One of the first times I did this, I accidentally doubled the quantity of
breadcrumbs, and I think the sausages were tastier for it, albeit with a bit
less structural integrity.

Ingredients
-----------

-   300g Lancashire cheese
-   180g[^bread qty] breadcrumbs (BÃ¼rgen Soya & Linseed works very well)
-   4 spring onions
-   2 whole eggs
-   1 egg yolk
-   1 clove's worth of garlic paste
-   25ml milk
-   Dried basil
-   Dried oregano
-   Black pepper

Process
-------

1.  Crumble the cheese into small pieces, 1cm absolute maximum size.
2.  Put the bread through a food processor to turn it into breadcrumbs.
3.  Mix all the ingredients together.
4.  Leave the mix in the fridge for at least two hours.
5.  Shape into sausages, and shallow fry in vegetable oil.
