Makes a lot of daal!

Ingredients
-----------

-   500g red lentils or yellow split peas or a mix thereof[^lentils]
-   1.5 litres water for cooking the lentils
-   250ml water for the masala
-   2 tablespoons turmeric
-   2 large or 3 small onions
-   A thumb of ginger
-   A bulb of garlic
-   One tin of tomatoes, or a similar quantity of passata or fresh tomato
-   A couple of star anise
-   A thumb of cinnamon stick
-   1 tablespoon mustard seed
-   3 tablespoons curry powder
-   2 tablespoons tamarind paste
-   Chilli powder and curry leaves to taste
-   Salt to taste[^salt]
-   Oil for frying

[^lentils]: A mix seems to work well; when we just used red lentils it was too
    mushy.
[^salt]: Official recipe was 3â€“4 tablespoons, I probably vote for a teaspoon.

Process
-------

1.  Add lentils, water and turmeric to the instant pot.
2.  Set the Instant Pot on manual, high pressure, with the pressure valve
    closed, for 10 minutes.
3.  In a large stock pot, fry the star anise and cinnamon, stirring
    occasionally.
4.  Finely chop the garlic, ginger and onion; using a food processor is good
    for this.
5.  Once the star anise and cinnamon is aromatic, add the mustard seed.
6.  Once the mustard seed is aromatic, add the garlic, ginger, onion, curry
    leaf and dried chilli.
7.  Stir the stock pot more-or-less continuously until everything is soft and
    starting to brown.
8.  Add the tomato and curry powder to the stock pot, and bring to a simmer.
9.  Add the water and tamarind to the stock pot.
10. Once the stock pot is nicely simmering and aromatic, the Instant Pot should
    be done with the lentils.  Add them to the stock pot.
11. Allow to simmer until you're done.  Add salt at the last minute.
