Lemon meringue pie
==================

Based on [this recipe from Make Me a Cocktail][0].  There are a lot of lemon
meringue pie recipes available that have the flavour of the *lemon* and the
*meringue*, but very few that also include the *biscuit base*.  That's what the
Frangelico adds!

Ingredients
-----------

-   1 measure lemon juice
-   Â½ measure sugar syrup
-   2 measures limonchello
-   1 measure frangelico
-   1 measure egg white

Process
-------

1.  Shake hard without ice for at least 30 seconds.
2.  Strain and serve.

Notes
-----

Make Me a Cocktail suggest using lemon liqueur rather than limoncello, which I
haven't tried.

Should try doing a double shake, first with ice to chill everything, then a
second time without ice to get air into the egg white.
