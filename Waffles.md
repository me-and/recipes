Overnight yeast waffles
=======================

Based on [Smitten Kitchen's essential raised waffles][0], but with some
significant modifications, mostly in the name of getting a thicker batter that
expands to fill my waffle iron rather than sadly pooling.

Ingredients
-----------

-   The night before
    -   400ml milk
    -   100g butter
    -   2tsp dried yeast
    -   250g plain flour
    -   1tsp salt
    -   1tsp sugar
-   The morning
    -   2 eggs
    -   ¼tsp bicarbonate of soda

Process
-------

-   The night before
    1.  Heat the milk in a pan to 40°C
    2.  Transfer the milk to a bowl and sprinkle the yeast over the top
    3.  Let the milk and yeast sit for 15 minutes
    4.  While the yeast is sitting, use the same pan to melt the butter; aim is to get the butter to the point it has only just melted, so some soft lumps are fine
    5.  After the yeast has had its 15 minutes, add the flour, sugar, salt and butter to the bowl, and whisk (doing this by hand has always been easy enough; it doesn't need to be perfect)
    6.  Cover the bowl with clingfilm and leave overnight
-   In the morning
    1.  Set the waffle irons heating
    2.  Add the eggs and bicarb to the bowl, and whisk; don't use an electric whisk, as that'll beat too much air out.
    3.  Brush the waffle irons with butter, and make waffles!
