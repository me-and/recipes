Japchae
=======

Based on the [Japchae recipe from Korean Bapsang][KB source].

This makes approximately two generous portions.

Ingredients
-----------

-   Main:
    -   Glass / sweet potato noodles
    -   1 carrot
    -   ½ onion
    -   2 spring onions
    -   ½ punnet mushrooms (alternatively or additionally: use a handful of
        rehydrated dried mushrooms for additional flavour)
    -   Large handful spinach
    -   Vegetable oil
-   Sauce:
    -   3½ tbsp soy sauce
    -   3 tbsp brown sugar (or similar palm sugar)
    -   2 tbsp sesame oil
    -   2 tsp minced garlic
    -   1 tbsp sesame seeds
    -   Black pepper
-   Jidan:
    -   2 eggs

Steps
-----

The novel point here, at least from my perspective, is that ingredients mostly
get cooked separately, and only combined at the end.  Although, per the linked
recipe, we're not doing this "properly" in the name of simplicity (at least
from my white Anglo perspective).

Aim with all the fried veg is that they should be taken out when they still
have a reasonable crunch.

1.  Prepare the main dish
    1.  Slice veg (except the spinach) into reasonably large thin bits: carrot
        becomes matchsticks, onion becomes thin slices, spring onion becomes
        inch-long segments, ...
    2.  Combine the sauce ingredients, mix thoroughly, microwave if necessary
        to get the sugar to dissolve.  Consider adding extra sesame seeds
        because they're tasty.
    3.  Cook the noodles according to the pack instructions.  Optionally retain
        the hot water for use in cooking the spinach.
    4.  Rinse the noodles under cold water, transfer to a bowl, then use
        kitchen scissors to chop into shorter lengths.
    5.  Add 3 tbsp of the sauce to the noodle bowl.
    6.  Boil some water and blanch[^blanch] the spinach until wilted.  Drain
        and shock under cold water.
    7.  Squeeze the water out of the spinach, then run a knife across it a few
        times to get small spinach piles.
    8.  **Don't miss this step!**[^miss] Add oil to the pan, then add the
        noodles and stir fry until translucent and a bit sticky, which should
        take a few minutes.  Return them to the bowl.
    9.  Stir fry the carrot.
    10. Once the carrot is half-cooked, add the onion and keep stirring.
    11. Once the onion is most of the way to cooked, add the spring onion.
    12. Transfer the vegetables to the bowl.
    13. Add the mushrooms and 2 tbsp of the sauce to the pan, and cook through.
    14. Add the mushrooms to the bowl along with the spinach and the remaining
        sauce.  Toss well and serve in bowls.
2.  Prepare the optional jidan topping
    1.  Separate the egg into bowls.
    2.  Stir the yolk until it's smooth.
    3.  Make a cutting motion through the white with a spoon several
        times.[^white]
    4.  Add a bit of oil to the pan and bring to a high temperature.
    5.  Pour out the white and spread thinly.
    6.  Pour the yolk on top, and spread that thinly too.
    7.  Cook each side briefly; the aim is to avoid any browning.
    8.  Remove the egg, roll it, and slice it thinly.

[^blanch]: Blanch = cook very briefly in boiling water.
[^miss]: I have no idea _how_ I keep missing this step, but I do.  And the meal
  isn't nearly as flavourful without it.
[^white]: I'm not 100% sure what the effect of this is, but I think it breaks
  the longest protein chains, and means the egg white essentially acts like a
  thinner liquid than it otherwise might.
