Flatbread
=========

Via [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/me-ander/733808996627120128/meant-to-take-photos-but-i-was-too-busy).

200g of yoghurt's worth of flatbread seemed like a reasonable brunch for two.  Serving with butter and honey worked well, Tumblr recommended balsamic or garlic butter, and serving with shakshuka sounds excellent.

Ingredients
-----------

-   Plain yoghurt[^1]
-   Flour[^2]
-   Pinch of salt
-   Olive oil

Process
-------

1.  Put your yoghurt and an equal weight of flour into a bowl, plus the pinch of salt.
2.  Knead until no longer sticky; add a bit more flour if required to achieve that.
3.  Put some oil down and roll the dough out flat.  About 2mm thick was tasty but a bit stodgy; about 0.5mm thick was a pain to work with because it kept falling apart (although that might be because I'd over-worked that bit of dough and it had absorbed too much oil from the work surface.[^3]
4.  Get a frying pan to a medium heat.  No need for non-stick.
5.  Dry fry (notwithstanding the oil from rolling it out).  It'll stick at first, but should be fine once it has cooked a bit.

[^1]: I used home-made yoghurt.
[^2]: Tumblr suggested using self-raising flour; I used plain flour.  I should try using self-raising next time!
[^3]: I realised too late that I should probably have added a bit more flour at that point, and should also try to remember that for next time.
