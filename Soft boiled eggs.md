# Soft boiled eggs

Based on Delia Smith's [_How to boil an egg_](http://www.deliaonline.com/how-to-cook/eggs/how-to-boil-an-egg.html):

## Steps

1. Get as small a pan as possible for the eggs, and bring enough water up to simmer to cover the eggs by about 1cm.
2. Lower the eggs into the water carefully, and simmer for 60 seconds.
3. Take the pan off the heat, put a lid on, and let sit according to the timings below.

Delia recommends 6 minutes for "a soft, fairly liquid yolk and a white that is just set but still quite wobbly", or 7 minutes for "a firmer, more creamy yolk with a white that is completely set".

If I'm having multiple eggs, I like to give whichever one I'm eating first an extra 30 seconds, as the others will cook a bit while they're waiting. Medium, room temperature eggs want 5:30 for ones I'm not eating straight away and 6 minutes for the one I'm eating first. Experimentation suggests adding ~60 seconds for eggs from the fridge, and/or ~30 seconds for large eggs rather than medium.
