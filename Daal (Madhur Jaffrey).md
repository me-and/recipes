Daal
====

Based in part on the recipe in the Madhur Jaffrey's _An Introduction to Indian
Cooking_, "Lentils".

Ingredients
-----------

-   For the main daal:
    -   1lb lentils (Madhur Jaffrey says 50:50 yellow split pea and red lentil,
        but the mix can clearly be varied)
    -   2–3" cinnamon stick
    -   1 bay leaf
    -   5 whole garlic cloves
    -   ½" ginger
    -   1tsp turmeric powder
    -   1½tsp salt
    -   2½ pints / 50 fl. oz. water
    -   Optional: ½ lemon, sliced
-   Optional extra flavouring:
    -   Pinch of asafetida powder
    -   ½tsp whole cumin

Process
-------

I've ended up with two sets of notes on this.  One said cook for 20 minutes at
high pressure on the "bean" setting, the other for 50 minutes at high pressure
no the manual setting.

Because it confused me previously: the "+" button on the Instant Pot is
genuinely a button, and is the button to use for setting the time.  Make sure
the vent is in the "pressure" setting.

If using the asafetida and cumin, fry them separately in oil until the cumin
seeds darken, then add to the daal before servingy.

Notes
-----

-   Could try slicing an onion and adding it with the dry ingredients?
