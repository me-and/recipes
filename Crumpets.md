Crumpets
========

Based on [Warburtons' crumpets recipe][1].

[1]: https://www.warburtons.co.uk/news/crumpet-recipe-revealed/

Ingredients
-----------

-   150g plain white flour
-   200ml water
-   ½ teaspoon salt
-   ½ teaspoon sugar
-   1 teaspoon baking powder
-   1 teaspoon dried yeast
-   Butter for frying

Process
-------

1.  Add flour, water and salt to a mixing bowl (make sure to use a bowl with a
    reasonable amount of space).
2.  Whisk with an electric whisk until thoroughly combined[^1]
3.  Add the sugar, yeast and baking powder[^2], whisk until thoroughly combined
    again.
4.  Cover mixing bowl with a tea towel and leave in a warm place for 15
    minutes.
5.  Get a well-seasoned cast-iron frying pan[^3] and some metal cookie cutters
    or similar; grease both with butter and get up to a medium-high heat.
6.  Give the batter a stir and add an appropriate amount of batter (which will
    depend on the size of the moulds you're using) to each.
7.  Lift the ring off once the crumpet edges have set, then cook until
    appropriately browned, flipping if desired.
8.  Serve hot, or allow to cool and toast later.

[^1]: The original recipe assumes you're going to be whisking by hand, and says
  it'll take at least five minutes.  That sounds miserable, and there's no good
  reason to not use an electric whisk.
[^2]: Warburtons suggest making the yeast into a paste first, which would
  reduce the chances of it clumping while being mixed up.  But given we're
  using an electric whisk, that doesn't seem to be necessary.
[^3]: Warburtons advocate for non-stick; I don't like using any metal utensils
  on non-stick surfaces.

Notes
-----

For pikelets, just fry directly in the pan rather than using rings.
